# Jarvis
Jarvis is a makeshift AI (non machine-learning) that can perform several functions including making calls to Wikipedia and WolframAlpha on a Mac. The program takes spoken English input, parses it, makes API calls, and returns spoken output.

Jarvis is written in Python 2 and relies on the following imported modules:
speech_recognition
DictionaryServices (part of pyobjc)
wolframalpha
